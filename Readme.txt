The subfolder "data" contains the results from 128 simulations.
The subfolder "image" contains 256 plots from 128 simulations scenarios, with and without sample splitting.
The subfolder "report_image" contains plots that have significant differences.
simulationA.RMD-simulationH.RMD contain the codes to generate 128 simulation scenarios. 
simulationA.RMD-simulationD correspond to simulations with XGBOOST and simulationE.RMD-simulationH correspond to simulations with LASSO
Fig2.RMD contains the codes to generate the plots in Section 3 of the report.
plot.RMD contains the codes to generate the plots subfolder 'image' and 'report_image'
